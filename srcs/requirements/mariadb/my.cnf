# The MariaDB/MySQL tools read configuration files in the following order: 28,22         All
# 1. /etc/mysql/mariadb.cnf (this file) to set global defaults,
# 2. /etc/mysql/conf.d/*.cnf to set global options.
# 3. /etc/mysql/mariadb.conf.d/*.cnf to set MariaDB-only options.
# 4. ~/.my.cnf to set user-specific options.
#
# If the same option is defined multiple times, the last one will apply.
#
# One can use all long options that the program supports.
# Run program with --help to get a list of available options and with
# --print-defaults to see which it would actually understand and use.

#
# This group is read both both by the client and the server
# use it for options that affect everything
